The Politics of India works within the framework of the country's constitution.
India is a parliamentary secular democratic republic in which the President of India is the head of state and the Prime Minister of India is the head of government. 
It is based on the federal structure of government although the word is not used in the constitution itself.
There is a provision for a bicameral legislature consisting of an upper house, the Rajya Sabha (Council of States), 
which represents the states of the Indian federation, and a lower house, 
the Lok Sabha (House of the People), which represents the people of India as a whole.
