The romance genre is defined by intimate relationships. 
Sometimes these movies can have a darker twist, 
but the idea is to lean on the natural conflict derived from the pursuit of intimacy and love. 
The romance-drama sub-genre is defined by the conflict generated from a  romantic relationship.
What makes a romance-drama different from a romantic-thriller is both the source of the drama
but also the intentions and motivations that drive each characterâ€™s perspective.
