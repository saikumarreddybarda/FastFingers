BJP’s massive re-election victory:-
Maybe the biggest thing 2019 told us was actually about 2014.
Five years ago, prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and 
his BJP notched up a huge victory, earning the first Lok Sabha majority in 30 years.
Amit Shah’s year:-
While we can observe how the BJP is operating when it is up against others, 
few have a good understanding of the dynamic within the party. 
In particularly, the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah relationship – easily the most 
important political combination of the decade – is little understood.
Hindutva’s year – until the Citizenship Act
Triple talaq criminalisation, done. Article 370, removed. Ram Mandir, decks cleared. Citizenship Act, passed. Despite the economic downturn, the government focused all of its political energies on core BJP Hindu nationalist demands – and initially seemed to achieve them with remarkable ease.
